                Patty's travel log is a full stack application that uses the Mongodb, Express.js, React.js and Node.js (MERN) stack, 
                along with react-map-gl. File upload is done with the help of the multer middleware. React-map-gl is a React wrapper component for the Mapbox API, and is 
                part of Uber visualization's framework suite. Markers are added to map
